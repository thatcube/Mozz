// MARK: - Adaptive layout rules
//
// Where navigation, the dock and the player sit at a given width — as rules,
// not as `if wide` scattered through the views.
//
// The twin of Android's `PlayerLayout.kt`, and deliberately the same shape:
// arithmetic and enums, no view code, so what travels between the clients is the
// *reasoning* — which panel shows where, what the dock morphs from — rather than
// a screenful of one platform's UI framework. Anything a second client would
// have to guess at belongs here with a comment saying why.
//
// See ADR-0016.

/// How the expanded player arranges itself.
///
/// Note there is exactly one piece of *state* behind this — `PlayerPanel?` — and
/// width only decides how that state is drawn. That is the whole design: closing
/// the queue means the same thing on a phone and an iPad, so rotating (or, on a
/// folding phone, unfolding) mid-song rearranges the screen without ever
/// changing what you asked for.

    /// No panel: artwork centred, given the whole width.
    case artwork

    /// Player on the left, queue or lyrics in a column of their own on the right.
    case panelBeside

    /// The panel takes the artwork's place, leaving the transport where it was.
    /// The only honest option when there is one column.

/// The navigation rail: the bottom bar stood on its end, used instead of it once
/// there is width for two columns.
///
/// The dock does **not** move with it. It is the same floating pill at every
/// width — bottom of the content area, capped at `BottomBar.dockMaxWidth` — and
/// only what it clears changes: a tab bar's worth on a phone, nothing beside a
/// rail. That is what lets one morph serve both instead of a phone morph and a

    /// and nothing runs underneath it. A navigation surface laid over the content
    /// it navigates reads as something in the way, and neither iPadOS nor Android
    /// does it — Apple Music's sidebar pushes its content aside, and Android's
    /// rail is a sibling in a `Row`.

/// here now and each surface asks.
