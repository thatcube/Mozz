///     and touch again once it's settled at the top.
///   • **Began already settled at the top** → a drawer pull. The scroll's overscroll
///     bounce is frozen so the content can't rubber-band, and the whole drawer drags
///     1:1 with the finger. (Dragging UP still scrolls down into the list normally —
