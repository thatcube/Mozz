// MARK: - Morph container (Candidate B: pure custom Liquid Glass)
//
// The mini island and the full-screen drawer are ONE view that morphs between
// two states. There is no native `tabViewBottomAccessory` and no cross-layer
// hand-off: the container literally *is* the island, so the collapse clip, the
// receive-bounce and the glass settle all fall out of one set of geometry
// interpolations. Two scalars drive everything:
//
//   • `p`     ∈ [0,1]  expand progress. 0 = island, 1 = full drawer. Only the
//                      open/collapse springs move it — never the drag.
//   • `dragY` ≥ 0      live finger translation while dragging the open drawer
//                      down. The whole surface rides the finger 1:1, fully
//                      opaque; the morph/fade happens ONLY on release.
//
// Because `p` stays pinned at 1 for the entire drag, the surface is full-size
// and fully opaque the whole time a finger is down — nothing clips, glasses, or
// fades mid-drag, and the mini controls stay hidden. Letting go animates `p` → 0,
// which shrinks the surface up to the island frame (clipping the body away),
// fades the body out, fades the mini controls in, dissolves the frost into
// Liquid Glass and lands the artwork in the slot.
/// The two secondary surfaces that can take the now-playing hero's place in the
/// expanded player. They are mutually exclusive because they share one slot — and
/// one set of open/close progresses — so exactly one can be on screen at a time.
