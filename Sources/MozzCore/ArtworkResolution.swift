/// phone-sized window. On a @3x iPhone that made every cover a third short of the
/// pixels it was drawn at, and on a large window it made the hero a soft upscale
/// of a phone-sized image. The number a slot needs is not a constant; it is the
/// slot's own size in points multiplied by the display's scale.
///
/// Asking for exactly that would be worse, though. Each distinct size is a
/// separate transcode on the server and a separate entry in every cache, so a
/// layout that measures 331pt on one device and 334pt on another would fetch the
/// same cover twice. Requests are therefore snapped UP to a rung: sizes cluster
/// on a handful of values that devices share, and no cover is ever smaller than
/// the box it fills.
